# DTPSP (Deep Time Point Selector and Profiler)

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for selecting optimal time points in single-cell analysis. The goal is to maximize the information learned from single-cell experiments by predicting the most informative time points for data collection. The model uses features derived from gene expression data to inform decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts optimal time points for single-cell analysis.
- Supports pseudobulk and bulk RNA-seq data preprocessing.
- Uses a hybrid neural network for time series prediction.
